            <h1>History of the Android Mascot</h1>

            <p>You probably know that <strong>Android</strong>, the operating system maintained by <strong>Google</strong>, is one of the most widely used for mobile devices worldwide. But did you know that its friendly mascot has a name and a very curious story? Follow this article to learn more about this little robot!</p>

            <h2>The First Version</h2>

            <p>The first attempt to create a mascot came in 2007 and was made by a developer named <a href="https://androidcommunity.com/dan-morrill-shows-us-the-android-mascot-that-almost-was-20130103/" target="_blank" class="externo">Dan Morrill</a>. He recounts that he opened <a href="https://inkscape.softonic.com.br/" target="_blank" class="externo">Inkscape</a> (a free image vectorization software) and created his own version of a robot. The goal was simply to personify the system for his team; there was no request from the company to create a mascot.</p>

            <p>This bizarre initial version was even named in honor of its creator: they were called the <strong>Dandroids</strong>.</p>

            <h2>A New Mascot Emerges</h2>

            <p>The idea of having a mascot evolved, and the task was handed over to a professional in the field. Russian illustrator <a href="https://www.irinablok.com/" target="_blank" class="externo">Irina Blok</a>, also a Google employee, was given the mission of representing the little robot in a more appealing way.</p>

            </picture>

            <p>Irina's main idea was to depict everything graphically with few lines and in a flat style. The design also needed to create an instant connection with the viewer. This is how <strong>Bugdroid</strong>, the new Android mascot, came to life.</p>

            <img src="imagens/bugdroid.png" class="pequena" alt="Bugdroid1s image">

            <p>The main inspiration for <strong>Bugdroid's</strong> design came from the figures used on restroom doors to indicate gender. Legend has it that the artist was sketching at her desk in <strong>Google's</strong> office, glanced toward the restrooms, and immediately found her inspiration: simple, clean, and straightforward.</p>

                <p>Another interesting aspect of Android is that each version was named after a dessert, in alphabetical order, from version 1.5 to 9.0:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>1.5 - <abbr title="Cake in a cup">Cupcake</abbr></li>
                    <li>1.6 - <abbr title="">Donut</abbr></li>
                    <li>2.0 - <abbr title="">Eclair</abbr></li>
                    <li>2.2 - <abbr title="">Froyo</abbr></li>
                    <li>2.3 - <abbr title="Christmas cookie">Gingerbread</abbr></li>
                    <li>3.0 - <abbr title="">Honeycomb</abbr></li>
                    <li>4.0 - <abbr title="">Ice Cream Sandwich</abbr></li>
                    <li>4.1 - <abbr title="">Jelly Bean</abbr></li>
                    <li>4.4 - <abbr title="">KitKat</abbr></li>
                    <li>5.0 - <abbr title="">Lollipop</abbr></li>
                    <li>6.0 - <abbr title="">Marshmallow</abbr></li>
                    <li>7.0 - <abbr title="">Nougat</abbr></li>
                    <li>8.0 - <abbr title="">Oreo</abbr></li>
                    <li>9.0 - <abbr title="">Pie</abbr></li>
                </ul>

                <p>Unfortunately, <strong>Android Q</strong> never existed, as Google decided to end this fun tradition and switched to numeric naming, starting with Android 10.</p>
